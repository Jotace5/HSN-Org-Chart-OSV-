## Project Scope Document

### 1. Project Information
- **Project Title**: Organizational Structure Viewer (OSV) for the Argentine National Congress
- **Project Sponsor**: Direction of Organizational and Administrative Systems
- **Project Manager**: Juan Manuel Casta√±o Pailos, Direction of Organizational and Administrative Systems
- **Date**: October 1, 2024

### 2. Purpose and Justification
- **Purpose**: The Organizational Structure Viewer (OSV) is an interactive web application designed to visually map and display the organizational structure of the Argentine National Congress. It aims to enhance transparency, accessibility, and efficiency in managing and viewing organizational data.

The OSV will streamline data management through automation, provide an intuitive user interface for easy navigation, and ensure that stakeholders have real-time access to up-to-date information. This will facilitate better decision-making, improve transparency, and reduce the administrative burden on staff.

### 3. Project Objectives
- **Develop an Interactive Organizational Map**: Create a hierarchical and network visualization of departments, committees, and individual roles within the National Congress by March 31, 2025.
- **Implement Robust Search Functionality**: Enable users to search by name, role, or department with advanced filtering options by December 15, 2024.
- **Automate Data Extraction Processes**: Develop and deploy automated tools to regularly update the organizational database from official sources by December 15, 2024.
