Next Steps for Session-Based Authentication:
Set Up User Login System:

Implement a login form where users can enter their credentials.
Upon successful login, create a session for the user and store the session ID in a cookie.
Session Management:

Ensure that the session is stored securely on the server, and the session ID is stored in a secure, HTTP-only cookie on the client.
Set appropriate session expiration times (e.g., log the user out after a period of inactivity).
Restrict Access:

Only allow users with a valid session to access the app and interact with the data.
Use middleware or guards in your framework to check for an active session before granting access to any page.
Logout Functionality:

Provide a logout option that destroys the session and removes the session cookie from the client.
