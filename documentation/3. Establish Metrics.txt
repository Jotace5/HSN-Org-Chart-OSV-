a. Define Clear Objectives
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

Based on your project scope, your objectives might include:

	- Usability: Ensure the application is easy to use and navigate. (PENDING)

	- Efficiency: Reduce the time required to access and update organizational data.
		How to Achieve It:
		- Performance Optimization: Ensure that the application runs smoothly with minimal lag.
		- Automation: Automate repetitive tasks to save time.
		- Streamlined Processes: Review and refine workflows to eliminate unnecessary steps.

	- Accuracy: Maintain up-to-date and accurate organizational information.
		How to Achieve It:
		- Data Validation: Implement robust data validation rules to prevent incorrect data entry.
		- Regular Audits: Schedule periodic data audits to identify and correct discrepancies.
		- Real-Time Updates: Ensure that data synchronization occurs in real-time to maintain accuracy.

	- Accessibility: Ensure the application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. (PENDING)

Performance Metrics:

	- Response Time: Ensure API calls and page loads meet acceptable speed thresholds (e.g., <2 seconds).
	- System Uptime: Aim for high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Set Up Simple Tracking Mechanisms:

	- Task Timers: Implement basic logging within the app to capture task start and end times.

	- Data Audits: Schedule regular manual reviews or use simple scripts to check for data inconsistencies.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Regular Review Schedule:

	- Weekly Check-ins: Review the collected data weekly to identify any immediate areas for improvement.

	- Monthly Reports: Compile monthly summaries to track progress against your goals.
